# Adam Grimes

- A range that breaks out in the continuation of the trend, is not as exciting
  as a range that breaks out opposite to the trend - as that leads to a more sharper fallout

- Ranges can expand without breaking

- Consolidation against the range sets up failure

  - Bouncing ball pattern near S/R levels,
  - Multiple tests weaken the range.

- Most ranges are continuation ranges - we expect trends to continue
