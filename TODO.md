- have wrapped up all major pieces for the BNF directional option selling


## TODOs
  1. Test if the exit strat works - haven't been able to check if we're able to get ST value of option that's sold
  2. ✅ Code the logic that'd place another order as per martingale
  3. ✅ deploy signalx.trade on DO
  4. ✅ build the khaching connection to signalx.trade
