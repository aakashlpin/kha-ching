### Exit strategies:
  1. SLM buy orders
    1.1. Buy the leg that hits the SL (configurable quantity 2x)
  2. Combined legs premium based SL
  3. Profit = if one leg was to hit SL and other was brought to cost


Do we need a interrupt to stop the exit strategy?

Want to build:

- See max loss as per strategy before placing the order
- Auto square off (at 3.15)
